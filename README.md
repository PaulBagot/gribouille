## A Drawing App I Built During My Studies

### Language

This is a Java project created using the JavaFX framework, which makes it easy to implement cool GUI features.

### Features

#### The app consists of a large canvas that you can draw on using either the left or right mouse button:

- While dragging the mouse with the **left button** pressed, you can draw a line in the selected color that follows your cursor.
- While dragging the mouse with the **right button** pressed, you can draw a shape in the selected color that grows larger the farther you move the cursor.

#### A taskbar provides access to advanced tools, such as:

- Saving your drawings
- Loading previously saved drawings into the app
- Picking a new color
- Choosing a different shape for the right mouse button

#### Some shortcuts:

- **Ctrl + Z** to undo your last action
- **Ctrl + Y** to redo the last undone action
- **Ctrl + S** to save your project
